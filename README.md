# APUE-Final
Stevens Institute of Technology - CS 631 - APUE - Final - Simple Shell

## NAME
sish —a simple hell

## SYNOPSIS
sish [ −x] [ −c command]

## DESCRIPTION
sish implements a very simple command-line interpreter or shell. It is suitable to be used interactively or
as a login shell. It only implements a very small subset of what would usually be expected of a Unix shell,
and does explicitly not lend itself as a scripting language.
